This web application takes in Resume and Recommendation Letter files and parses through the file to extract the text. Our website then returns a modified version of the text with gender-neutral vocabulary(e.g. she/he is replaced with they) and initialized names(e.g. John Smith becomes JS) to reduce any biases during the selection process of jobs. The employer can then search our database with an applicant's initials and unique 5-character ID in order to find the applicant's contact information and real name.
